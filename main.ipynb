    "# Notes for myself\n",
    "## Coding up will be sth like:\n",
    "1. Step 1 - generate simulation in 2d continuous space (mesh points) (easyish but also it is me so probably very very hard)\n",
    "* Parameters:\n",
    "    * nr tables\n",
    "    * nr objects\n",
    "    * nr objects per table?\n",
    "    * tables_shape - \"rectangle, non-rectangle\n",
    "    * rooms? walls?\n",
    "    * shape of objects ?\n",
    "    * Assume always the same size of the room. Add parameter for the scale of the room - that's gonna have a massive impact on the computational power - wish my brain was as massive but that is for another day\n",
    "2. Step 2 - graph the simulation (how?)\n",
    "* raaaaaaah, here is your answer to how:\n",
    "* we get a pen and paper\n",
    "* we also get a ruler cos we gotta draw dem lines straight yo\n",
    "* draw two straight lines parallel to paper. call them x and y. doesn't matter which is which. if anyone complains tell them to rotate the paper\n",
    "* draw another straight line in any angle. We call it z. This doesn't do anything but seems like we are doing some PhD math...\n",
    "* draw some squiggly lines in different colours\n",
    "* different colours for all following:\n",
    "    * robot\n",
    "    * tables\n",
    "    * object (sub-different colours fot different shapes?)\n",
    "    * generated trajectory?\n",
    "    * crazy\n",
    "    * hotness (if you know you know)\n",
    "4. Step 4 - implement ORLA* and test in the environment\n",
    "5. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic can be thought as roughly this while-loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. a. while I exist\n",
    "0. b. I continue to exist.\n"
